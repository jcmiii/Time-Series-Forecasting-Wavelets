# Time-Series-Forecasting-Wavelets
Wavelet time series forecasting techniques applied to futures and equities

Summary:
A study of discrete wavelet time series forecasting techniques applied to oil futures and equities data. The project is based on the article, *Wavelet-based Prediction of Oil Prices*, by Yousefi, Weinreich, and Reinarz (2005). A text that covers these ideas is *Wavelet methods for time series analysis* by Percival and Walden.

Code is in Mathematica.   
Included are slides from talks related to this project.
